As a summer intern, I had the opportunity to work on a thrilling project that aimed to develop a local storage online file sharing service. The project was a true testament to the potential of modern technologies, as it brought together Angular, Node.js with Express.js, Minio with S3 SDK, MongoDB, WebSockets, JWT, and HTTPS to create a seamless and secure solution for file sharing in a local environment.

One of the most exciting aspects of this project was the utilization of Minio's S3 compatibility. This enabled us to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of Amazon S3, while still maintaining the security and privacy of data stored within a local network. This was a major advantage for our target users, who were looking for an efficient and secure way to store and share files within their local environment.

Additionally, the implementation of WebSockets was a game-changer, allowing for real-time data transfer and communication. This added a new dimension of interactivity to the user experience, making the file sharing process smoother and more enjoyable.

But, the security of the data was always the top priority. That's why we used JWT and HTTPS to ensure that the data transmission was secure and protected. These measures helped to prevent unauthorized access and ensured that the users' data was safe and secure at all times.
